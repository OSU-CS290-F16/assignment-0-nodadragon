<h2>Assignment 0 - 9/24/16</h2>
The first assginment wasn't too difficult to finish, but I found it useful to understand the basics of Git and GitHub, and refresh on some html coding since it has been awhille since I have done any work on sites. I ran into a few problems when I was starting on GitHub but I figured it out after going through the tutorials provided. The html side of the assignment wasn't too dificult for me, because I've had some experience with it before and there wasn't much too it. I look forward to the future assignments and hope I learn alot about designing websites.
